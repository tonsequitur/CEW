    <h1>Open Loop Conveyor Belt</h1><em><p>I chose this piece because it evokes movement and perspective. However, rather than the lines being part of a closed loop, I have them open-ended to infinity. The lines have a random stroke color to emulate movement on the conveyor. The lines themselves are generated from 'for' loops within a certain x/y parameter. The shape drawings were created with vertices and the spinning effect on the circles use opaque arcs. I had trouble figuring out how to step the lines's x and y values decrementally when I started out with the perspective going the other way. -= never seemed to work for me. â€” Maureen Ton, Feb 21, 2019</em><br><br>Revised to include start/stop buttons, Mar 7, 2019
